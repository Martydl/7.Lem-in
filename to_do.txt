- fix make error w/ ft_err conflict (redo Makefiles) ✓

- add start/end part ✓

- full error function ✓︎︎︎︎︎︎︎︎

- add colors to printf ✓︎

- add empty int opti to matrix ✓︎

- bfs ✓︎
- add conflicts management

- perhaps a real main ?

- secure malloc returns realistically :'(

-  ALGO
	- check room nblinks before bfs
	- generate a common denominator based on the shortest way, add them and compare the results
		- doesnt take into account the ammount of ants
		-  separate each way, longest = bad, shortest not always good
		-  maybe base it on the longest ?
		- find a way to  determine wether or not a second  way is worth it
			- divide nb moves by nb ways, add extra moves on second lane

	requirements :
		- length of a way
		- relative comparison between lanes (w/ compatibility)
		- need a way to find moves per way accounting for ants and lane comparisons
